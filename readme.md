# Portfolio

## About me ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜‰: 
Hi, IÂ´m Lilia ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€. 
 This is my portfolio where I show some of the projects I have worked on. I hope you like them.
 
 I am a professional with a strong background and experience in the finance industry. I successfully transitioned into the role of QA tester, where I have been able to apply my analytical skills and meticulous approach to ensure software quality and reliability. I am known for my ability to work autonomously and in a team, adapt quickly to change, and make informed decisions in high-pressure situations. In addition, I possess excellent communication skills, allowing me to collaborate closely with developers, designers and other team members to achieve outstanding results.
